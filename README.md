Java8-style chainable comparators for Javascript


Raison d'Ãªtre
-------------

I played some with Java 8 and liked the new [Comparator](http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html) interface and the way it allows chaining comparators for multi-attribute sort like this:

```java
people.sort(
    Comparator.comparing(Person::getLastName)
        .thenComparing(Person::getFirstName)
);
```

At [work](http://siftit.com/), I've run across situations where I need multi-key sorts in my Backbone collections -- which can sort themselves if given a function of the same signature as those used by [`Array.prototype.sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort).

So the simple solution (for me) was to write an easy-to-read


Usage and examples
------------------

Directly translating our above Java 8 code, we could do the following:

```javascript
/* Demo data */
var people = [
  {lastName: "Baggins", firstName: "Bilbo"},
  {lastName: "Gamgee",  firstName: "Samwise"},
  {lastName: "Baggins", firstName: "Frodo"}
];

sortedPeople = people.sort(Comparators.comparing("lastName").thenComparing("firstName"));

/* sortedPeople is now:
[
  {lastName: "Baggins", firstName: "Bilbo"},
  {lastName: "Baggins", firstName: "Frodo"},
  {lastName: "Gamgee",  firstName: "Samwise"}
]; 
*/
```

Where and how can I use it?
---------------------------

It works in the browser and in anything that handles CommonJS modules.

In the browser, include `comparators.js` in a script tag:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="comparators.js"></script>
```

In node, just `require` it:

```javascript
var Comparators = require("Comparators.js");
```
